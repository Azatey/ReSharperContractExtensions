(0): ReSharper Warning: Auto-property accessor is never used
(1): ReSharper Dead Code: Method invocation is skipped. Compiler will not generate method invocation because the method is conditional, or it is partial method without implementation
(2): ReSharper Underlined Error Highlighting: User message to contract call can only be string literal, or static field,
or static property that is at least internally visible
