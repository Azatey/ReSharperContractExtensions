(0): ReSharper Underlined Error Highlighting: Malformed contract. Detected expression statement evaluated for side-effect in contracts of method 'Foo'
(1): ReSharper Dead Code: Method invocation is skipped. Compiler will not generate method invocation because the method is conditional, or it is partial method without implementation
(2): ReSharper Hint: Method 'InstanceMethod' can be made static
