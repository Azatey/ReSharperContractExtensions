(0): ReSharper Dead Code: Field '_foo' is assigned but its value is never used
(1): ReSharper Underlined Error Highlighting: Malformed contract. Assignment cannot be used in contract section of method 'Foo'
(2): ReSharper Dead Code: Method invocation is skipped. Compiler will not generate method invocation because the method is conditional, or it is partial method without implementation
