(0):<overlapped> ReSharper Suggestion: Field can be made readonly
(1): ReSharper Hint: Convert to constant
(2): ReSharper Warning: Auto-property accessor is never used
(3): ReSharper Dead Code: Method invocation is skipped. Compiler will not generate method invocation because the method is conditional, or it is partial method without implementation
