(0): ReSharper Underlined Error Highlighting: Member 'IsValid' has less visibility than the enclosing property 'Foo'
(1): ReSharper Dead Code: Method invocation is skipped. Compiler will not generate method invocation because the method is conditional, or it is partial method without implementation
