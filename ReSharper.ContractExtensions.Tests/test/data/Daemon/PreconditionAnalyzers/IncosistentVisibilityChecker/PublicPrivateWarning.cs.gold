---------------------------------------------------------
(0): ReSharper Underlined Error Highlighting: Member 'IsValid' has less visibility than the enclosing method 'Foo'
(1): ReSharper Dead Code: Method invocation is skipped. Compiler will not generate method invocation because the method is conditional, or it is partial method without implementation
(2): ReSharper Hint: Method 'IsValid' can be made static
(3): ReSharper Dead Code: Parameter 's' is never used
