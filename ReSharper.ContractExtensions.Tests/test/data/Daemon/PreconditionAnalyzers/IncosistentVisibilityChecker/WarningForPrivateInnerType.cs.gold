---------------------------------------------------------
(0): ReSharper Underlined Error Highlighting: Member 'Inner.IsValid' has less visibility than the enclosing method 'A.Foo'
(1): ReSharper Dead Code: Method invocation is skipped. Compiler will not generate method invocation because the method is conditional, or it is partial method without implementation
(2): ReSharper Suggestion: Class 'Inner' is never instantiated
