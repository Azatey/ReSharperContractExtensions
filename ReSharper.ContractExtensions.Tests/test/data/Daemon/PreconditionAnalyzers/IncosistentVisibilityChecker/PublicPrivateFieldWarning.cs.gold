---------------------------------------------------------
(0): ReSharper Warning [CS0649]: Field '_isValid' is never assigned
(1): ReSharper Underlined Error Highlighting: Member '_isValid' has less visibility than the enclosing method 'Foo'
(2): ReSharper Dead Code: Method invocation is skipped. Compiler will not generate method invocation because the method is conditional, or it is partial method without implementation
