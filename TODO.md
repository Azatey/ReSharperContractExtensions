# What next?

There is some issues with generating interfaces.

Maybe JB did something, but right now instead of implicit interface implementation regular implementation is used.

I'm leaving breaking tests to fix this in the future.

And to run the tests you need to copy all the additional folders from the main bin folder (from ContractExtensions themselves). No idea why this needed!
